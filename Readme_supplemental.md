**The Voynich Manuscript: A New Hypothesis
Ergotism, Cognitive Distortion, and Medieval Women’s Medicine**
This repository presents a new perspective on the Voynich Manuscript — one that does not rely on cryptography, lost languages, or hoaxes, but instead integrates historical ecology, medieval medicine, manuscript culture, and neuropsychology.
Core Hypothesis
The Voynich Manuscript may be a women’s medical and herbal manuscript produced by a scribe experiencing the cognitive effects of ergot poisoning.
This explanation accounts for:
the structured yet meaningless nature of Voynichese,
the distorted botanical imagery,
the balneological (bathing / therapeutic) diagrams,
the zodiac and reproductive references,
and the manuscript’s creation during a period of widespread ergot outbreaks in Central and Eastern Europe.
Instead of assuming encoded meaning, this hypothesis proposes that meaning collapsed during creation due to altered cognitive function.

Why This Hypothesis Fits
1. Historical Climate + Crop Patterns
Between 1400–1450, cold and wet seasons created perfect conditions for ergot fungus.
Rye — heavily used in Poland, Bohemia, and German-speaking regions — was highly vulnerable.
2. Monastic Scribe Culture
A monk copying medical and herbal texts has:
access to parchment, pigments, inks
training in herbal illustration
exposure to women's medicine via manuscripts
a bread-heavy diet prone to ergot contamination
3. Cognitive Effects Match Voynichese
Ergot alkaloids can cause:
hallucinations
symbolic fragmentation
language-like output without meaning
distorted botanical recall
melting, looping anatomical interpretations
All of these appear in the manuscript.
4. Visual Distortion Consistent with Ergotism
Botanical hybrids, pipe-like anatomy, surreal baths, and impossible fluid systems resemble known hallucination-driven distortions.
5. Explains Why AI and Cryptography Fail
There is no plaintext to uncover because the text is not encoding information — it is language-shaped noise produced by a mind struggling to maintain structure while meaning deteriorates.
Purpose of This Repository
This project is not intended as a definitive solution but as a historically grounded alternative hypothesis.
It invites interdisciplinary discussion and further refinement.
